This is the readme file for Peter and Tim's app.

## How to start building!

Notes: 

* Always consult Ionic's Documentation: https://ionicframework.com/docs/
* Always feel free to ask online, on slack on the appropriate channel and please stay in tight communication
* DON'T EVER APPROVE PULL REQUEST TO MASTER BRANCH
* ALWAYS USE DEVELOP BRANCH TO ADD FEATURES

### With the Ionic CLI:

// ----------------------

$ ionic serve

---------------------- //

- this command tests



```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myTabs tabs
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myTabs` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
